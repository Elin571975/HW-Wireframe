    <h2>Julia Louis-Dreyfus accepts the Twain Prize</h2>
    <h3> October 21 at 11:39 PM </h3>             
            
    <p class="article">After an evening of stand-up sets, comedy sketches and sentimental praise for Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the presentation of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center on Sunday ended with the funniest bit — one delivered by the honoree herself.</p>
    <p class="article">“When Mark Twain first emailed me about the Mark Twain prize, I have to admit I totally misunderstood. I thought I was being asked to honor someone else,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “What a hassle. I have to go all the way to Washington, D.C., and make up flattering things to say about how funny someone else is.</p>
    <p class="article">"And then I realized. It’s me. I get the prize, and my attitude about the whole thing changed. It really did,” she said. “This is a great night, a great honor. Anybody would be lucky to be part of a night like this honoring someone like me.”</p>
